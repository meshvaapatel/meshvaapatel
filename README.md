## 📝 About Me

I don’t just analyze data—I listen to it. Behind every number is a story, a problem, a possibility.

My toolkit includes **Python, SQL, Power BI, and Excel**. I turn complex data into clear insights and actionable strategies.

AI & ML spark my curiosity because every algorithm is a chance to solve real-world problems. I’m mastering the math today to create measurable impact as a data scientist tomorrow.
