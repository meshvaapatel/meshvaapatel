## 📝 About Me

I’m a data analyst who works with Python, SQL, Power BI, and Excel to turn raw data into clear insights. I focus on understanding the data, finding patterns, and presenting results in a way that supports good decision-making.

I’m currently learning more about AI and Machine Learning to strengthen my analytical approach and handle more advanced tasks. This includes understanding how models work, how to prepare data for them, and how they can support practical business questions.
