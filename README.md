## 📂 Featured Projects

### [Smartphone Price Prediction System](https://github.com/meshvaapatel/smartphone-price-prediction-system)
     
A practical machine-learning project where I built a regression model to predict smartphone prices using key features such as brand, specifications, and performance metrics. The workflow covers web scraping, data cleaning, feature extraction, model training, and algorithm comparison to identify the most accurate predictor. The project demonstrates how structured data and ML techniques can support smarter pricing decisions and market positioning.

### [Cafe Sales Exploratory Data Analysis](https://github.com/meshvaapatel/cafe-sales-exploratory-data-analysis)

An exploratory analysis of café sales data to track how revenue changes by day, month, and product category. I analyzed 15,000+ transactions using Python to identify peak months, high-selling items, and seasonal demand patterns. I also built a Power BI dashboard that highlights top-performing categories like Juice, Coffee, and Cake and visualizes sales trends, payment behavior, and location insights to support smarter menu and operational decisions.

### [Retail SQL Analysis](https://github.com/meshvaapatel/retail-sql-analysis)

A SQL-driven retail analytics project where I analyzed linked tables such as demand, inventory, pricing, and product to extract actionable insights. Using joins, subqueries, and aggregation, I identified stock inefficiencies, pricing trends, and product-level performance. The analysis turns complex relational data into clear metrics and recommendations that support smarter inventory planning and pricing strategy.
